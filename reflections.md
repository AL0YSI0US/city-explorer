# Reflections

- [ ] The Demonstrations often lack supplemental documentation
  - [ ] It is expected of the students to go back and pull out information from the videos
- [ ] Trello or GitHub / honestly seeing both in full blown development mode setup like a sandbox should be the standard from the start.
  - [ ] sandbox : Trello in 102 { `outlines assignment requirements` }
  - [ ] sandbox : Trello in 201 { `outlines assignment requirements` }
  - [ ] sandbox : Github project board in 201 { `Used Collaboratively On Final Project` }
  - [ ] sandbox : Trello in 301 { `outlines assignment requirements` }
- [ ] If I need to create an account on a new website there should be a step by step guide of images to follow, **this is a pretty standard accessibility need in any environment**.
- [ ] Disability department??? Curiosity??? Does code fellows value accessibility? Do they know what the  general education standards are??
- [ ] Obtain class materials within 24hrs of payment for any class
- [ ] calsses should have no less than 2 to 3 weeks between them, students learners need rest and staff should be refining skills during this time. mentoring each other collaborating on advancements that better the learning environment etc
